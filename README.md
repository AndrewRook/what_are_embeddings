# What are embeddings? 
This repository contains the generated LaTex document, website, and complementary notebook code for 
["What are Embeddings".](https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/)

The [LaTex document](https://github.com/veekaybee/what_are_embeddings/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yaml) is written in Overleaf and deployed to GitHub, where it's compiled via Actions. The site is likewise generated via Actions from the `site` branch.  The notebooks are flying fast and free and not under any kind of CI whatsoever. 

## Contributing

If you have any changes that you'd like to make to the document including clarification or typo fixes, you'll need to build the LaTeX artifact. I use GitHub to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`. 
2. Make your changes in your fork. 
3. Make sure that your LaTeX document compiles. The GH action that triggers the PDF is set to run on PR. 
4. Ensure that the document compiles to a PDF correctly and inspect the output. 
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
